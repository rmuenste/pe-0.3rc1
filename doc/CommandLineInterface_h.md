A summary of the functionality provided in the `CommandLineInterface` class from your C++ code:

---

### **1. Purpose of the Class**
The `CommandLineInterface` class is a wrapper around Boost's Program Options library. It provides functionality to parse and manage command-line arguments for applications within the `pe` namespace.

---

### **2. Key Features**

#### **Singleton Design Pattern**
- The class uses a singleton pattern:
  - A static pointer (`instance_`) ensures only one instance of `CommandLineInterface` exists.
  - The public method `getInstance()` provides access to this single instance, creating it if necessary.

#### **Member Variables**
- Two key member variables are used to handle command-line options:
  - `options_description desc_`: Stores descriptions of the available command-line options.
  - `variables_map vm_`: Stores parsed values from the command line after processing.

#### **Core Functions**

##### *CLI Option Management*
- The class provides functions to access and modify CLI-related data:
  - `getDescription()` (read/write or read-only): Accesses the descriptions of CLI options.
  - `getVariablesMap()` (read/write or read-only): Accesses the parsed values of CLI options.

##### *Parsing and Evaluating Options*
- Functions to handle parsing and evaluation:
  - `parse(int argc, char* argv[])`: Parses command-line arguments based on registered option descriptions.
  - `evaluateOptions()`: Processes or evaluates parsed options further as needed.

##### *Helper Functions for Contact Solvers*
- Template-based helper functions for extensibility with specific "contact solver" configurations:
  - `evaluateContactSolverOptions<T>()`: Placeholder for evaluating specific contact solver settings.
  - `addContactSolverOptions<T>()`: Placeholder for adding contact solver-specific options.

These functions appear to be designed for future extension but are currently empty (`inline` methods with no implementation).

---

### **3. Notable Characteristics**

#### Integration with Boost.Program_options
- Leverages Boost's powerful program options library for managing user input via CLI, making it easier to define, parse, and retrieve arguments.

#### Lightweight Implementation
- The actual implementation is minimalistic; many methods serve as wrappers or placeholders for potential customization (e.g., contact solver-related methods).

#### Extensibility
- Template-based helper functions (`evaluateContactSolverOptions`, `addContactSolverOptions`) suggest that this class can be extended generically for different use cases without modifying its core structure.

---

### **4. Missing/Unimplemented Details**
While functional, some parts of this code are incomplete or placeholders:
1. No destructor is explicitly defined; however, since smart pointers (`std::auto_ptr`) are used, memory cleanup should happen automatically.
2. Helper functions related to "contact solvers" are stubs with no logic implemented yet.
3. No actual CLI option definitions or parsing logic is shown in this fileâ€”this would need to be added elsewhere in your application.

---

In summary, this file defines a flexible and extensible wrapper around Boost.Program_options that uses a singleton pattern and offers basic functionality like option registration, parsing, and retrieval while leaving room for future extensions like "contact solver" configurations.
