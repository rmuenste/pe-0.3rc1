/*!\brief Selection of the complementarity solver.

 *   - pe::solver::PGS
 *   - pe::solver::CPG

/*!\brief Maximum number of iterations of the complementarity solver.
 * \ingroup config
 *
 * This value specifies the maximum number of iteration steps the complementarity solver
 * is performing for a single LCP problem. The choice of the number of iteration steps is a
 * consideration between the accuracy of the solution and the time to solution: for a large
 * number of iteration steps, the solution will be more accurate, whereas a small number
 * will be considerable faster to calculate. For instance, an important property of the PGS
 * solver is that the convergence speed of the approximated solution is strongly decreasing
 * with a larger number of time steps. In order to noticeably improve the solution, the
 * maximum number of time steps has to be considerably increased.
 *
 * Possible settings for the \a maxIterations variable: \f$ [1..\infty) \f$

/*!\brief Residuum threshold for the LCP solution of the complementarity solver.
 * \ingroup config
 *
 * This value specifies the threshold for the residuum calculation during a solution of a
 * single LCP problem. The calculation stops as soon as the approximated solution meets the
 * specified threshold value. The choice of the threshold value is a consideration between
 * the accuracy of the solution and the time to solution: for a small threshold value (e.g.
 * \f$ 1e-9 \f$), the solution will be more accurate, whereas a large threshold value (e.g.
 * \f$ 1e-5 \f$) will be considerable faster. For instance, an important property of the PGS
 * solver is that the convergance speed of the approximated solution is strongly decreasing
 * with a larger number of time steps. The time to solution for a LCP calculation using a
 * smaller threshold value will be noticeably larger.

/*!\brief Number of facets of the approximated friction cone.

 * the number of facets can be specified. The more facets are used, the more accurate the solver
 * can solve the frictional contact problem, but the slower the solver will be. The number of
 * facets can be set to any positive, even number greater-or-equal to 4.
