 * \ingroup util
 *
 * The logging submodule offers the functionality for the creation of log information in both
 * non-parallel and MPI-/thread-parallel environments. The logging functionality is implemented
 * such that in case no logging is required no runtime and memory overhead occur. However, in
 * case it is necessary to log information, this is done as efficiently and reliably as possible.
 * In non-parallel environments, a single log file named 'pe.log' is created, containing all
 * the information of the single process. In MPI-parallel environments, each process creates
 * his own log file named 'peX.log', where 'X' is replaced by his according process rank in
 * the MPI_COMM_WORLD communicator. Depending on the selected logging level information about
 * (severe) errors, warnings, important information, progress reports, debug information, and
 * detailed output is written to the log file(s). The global log level is specified via the
 * pe::loglevel variable in the configuration file "pe/config/Logging.h". The following logging
 * level's are available:
 *
 *  - \a inactive: Completely deactivates the logging functionality, i.e., no log file(s) will
 *                 be written. Since this setting can immensely complicate error correction, it
 *                 is not recommended to use this setting!
 *  - \a error   : Only (severe) errors are written to the log file(s).
 *  - \a warning : Extends the \a error setting by warning messages.
 *  - \a info    : Extends the \a warning setting by additional informative messages (default).
 *  - \a progress: Extends the \a info setting by progress information.
 *  - \a debug   : Extends the \a progress setting by debug information.
 *  - \a detail  : Extends the \a debug setting by very fine grained detail information.
 *
 * Logging is done via one of the six following log sections:
 *
 *  - pe::pe_LOG_ERROR_SECTION   : Section for (severe) error messages; pe::loglevel >= \a error
 *  - pe::pe_LOG_WARNING_SECTION : Section for warning messages; pe::loglevel >= \a warning
 *  - pe::pe_LOG_INFO_SECTION    : Section for important information; pe::loglevel >= \a info
 *  - pe::pe_LOG_PROGRESS_SECTION: Section for progress information; pe::loglevel >= \a progress
 *  - pe::pe_LOG_DEBUG_SECTION   : Section for debug information; pe::loglevel >= \a debug
 *  - pe::pe_LOG_DETAIL_SECTION  : Section for detail information; pe::loglevel >= \a detail
 *
 * The following example demonstrates the use of the log sections:

   \code
   int main( int argc, char** argv )
   {
      // Initialization of the MPI system (for MPI parallel simulations only)
      // The MPI system must be initialized before any logging functionality may be used. In
      // case it was not called before the first log section it is assumed that the simulation
      // does not run in parallel. Thus in MPI-parallel simulations it is strongly recommended
      // to make MPI_Init() the very first call of the main function.
      MPI_Init( &argc, &argv );

      // ...

      // Log section for error messages
      // This section is only executed in case the logging level is at least 'error'. The
      // macro parameter specifies the name of the log handle (in this example 'log') that
      // can be used as a stream to log any kind of streamable information.
      pe_LOG_ERROR_SECTION( log ) {
         log << " Only printed within an active pe_LOG_ERROR_SECTION\n"
             << "   for demonstration purposes!\n";
      }

      // Log section for warning messages
      // This section is only executed in case the logging level is at least 'warning'. Again,
      // the macro parameter specifies the name of the log handle that can be used as a stream
      // to any kind of streamable information.
      pe_LOG_WARNING_SECTION( log ) {
         log << " Only printed within an active pe_LOG_WARNING_SECTION!\n";
      }

      // ...

      // Finalizing the MPI system (for MPI parallel simulations only)
      // The MPI system must be finalized after the last pe functionality has been used. It
      // is recommended to make MPI_Finalize() the very last call of the main function.
      MPI_Finalize();
   }
   \endcode

 * Executing this main() function results in the following log file (provided the logging level
 * is set accordingly):

   \code
   --LOG BEGIN, Thursday, 14.January 2010, 08:31--------------------------------------------


   [ERROR   ]  Only printed within an active pe_LOG_ERROR_SECTION
                 for demonstration purposes!

   [WARNING ]  Only printed within an active pe_LOG_WARNING_SECTION!


   --LOG END, Thursday, 14.January 2010, 08:31----------------------------------------------
   \endcode

 * The next example shows to nested log sections. Please note that this combination only makes
 * sense in case the outer log section has a lower log level:

   \code
   // ...

   pe_LOG_ERROR_SECTION( error )
   {
      error << " Only printed within an active pe_LOG_ERROR_SECTION\n";

      pe_LOG_WARNING_SECTION( warning ) {
         warning << " Only printed within an active pe_LOG_WARNING_SECTION\n";
      }

      error << " Again only printed within an active pe_LOG_ERROR_SECTION\n";
   }

   // ...
   \endcode

 * Although the pe_LOG_ERROR_SECTION is the outer section, the pe_LOG_WARNING_SECTION appears
 * first in the log file:

   \code
   --LOG BEGIN, Thursday, 14.January 2010, 08:31--------------------------------------------


   [WARNING ]  Only printed within an active pe_LOG_WARNING_SECTION

   [ERROR   ]  Only printed within an active pe_LOG_ERROR_SECTION
               Again only printed within an active pe_LOG_ERROR_SECTION


   --LOG END, Thursday, 14.January 2010, 08:31----------------------------------------------
   \endcode

 * In order to commit the messages in the correct order, it is necessary to manually call the
 * commit function:

   \code
   // ...

   pe_LOG_ERROR_SECTION( error )
   {
      error << " Only printed within an active pe_LOG_ERROR_SECTION\n";

      // Manual call of the commit function
      error.commit();

      pe_LOG_WARNING_SECTION( warning ) {
         warning << " Only printed within an active pe_LOG_WARNING_SECTION\n";
      }

      error << " Again only printed within an active pe_LOG_ERROR_SECTION\n";
   }

   // ...
   \endcode

 * This results in the following log file:

   \code
   --LOG BEGIN, Thursday, 14.January 2010, 08:31--------------------------------------------


   [ERROR   ]  Only printed within an active pe_LOG_ERROR_SECTION

   [WARNING ]  Only printed within an active pe_LOG_WARNING_SECTION

   [ERROR   ]  Again only printed within an active pe_LOG_ERROR_SECTION


   --LOG END, Thursday, 14.January 2010, 08:31----------------------------------------------
   \endcode
