/*!\brief Logging levels.
 * \ingroup logging
 *
 * The LogLevel type enumeration represents the type of the global logging level. It defines
 * all possible levels for the logging functionality. Depending on the setting of the global
 * logging level (see pe::logLevel), more or less information will be written to the log file(s).
 * The following logging levels are available:
 *
 *  - \a inactive: Completely deactivates the logging functionality, i.e., no log file(s) will
 *                 be written. Since this setting can immensely complicate error correction, it
 *                 is not recommended to use this setting!
 *  - \a error   : Only (severe) errors are written to the log file(s).
 *  - \a warning : Extends the \a error setting by warning messages (default).
 *  - \a info    : Extends the \a warning setting by additional informative messages.
 *  - \a progress: Extends the \a info setting by progress information.
 *  - \a debug   : Extends the \a progress setting by debug information.
 *  - \a detail  : Extends the \a debug setting by very fine grained detail information.
 *
 * \a inactive plays a special role in the way that it switches off the logging functionality
 * completely, i.e., no log file(s) will be created. The highest logging level is \a error,
 * which exclusively writes severe errors to the log file(s). The lowest logging level is
 * \a detail, which can create a tremendous amount of logging information. Note that each
 * logging level comprises all higher logging levels. For instance, \a progress will also
 * print all errors and warning to the log file(s).
