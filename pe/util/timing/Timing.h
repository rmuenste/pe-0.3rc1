 *
 * The timing submodule offers the necessary functionality for timing and benchmarking purposes.
 * The central element of the timing module is the Timer class. Depending on a chosen timing
 * policy, this class offers the possibility to measure both single times and time series. In
 * order to make time measurement as easy as possible, the \b pe physics engine offers the two
 * classes WcTimer and CpuTimer (both using the Timer class) to measure both wall clock and CPU
 * time. The following example gives an impression on how time measurement for a single time
 * works with the the \b pe physics engine. Note that in this example the WcTimer could be easily
 * replaced with the CpuTimer if instead of the wall clock time the CPU time was to be measured.

   \code
   // Creating a new wall clock timer immediately starts a new time measurement
   WcTimer timer;

   ...  // Programm or code fragment to be measured

   // Stopping the time measurement
   timer.end();

   // Evaluation of the measured time
   double time = timer.last();
   \endcode

 * As already mentioned, it is also possible to start several time measurements with a single
 * timer to evaluate for instance the minimal, the maximal or the average time of a specific
 * task. The next example demonstrates a possible setup for such a series of time measurements:

   \code
   // Creating a new wall clock timer
   WcTimer timer;

   ...  // Additional setup code

   // Starting 10 wall clock time measurements
   for( unsigned int i=0; i<10; ++i ) {
      timer.start();
      ...  // Programm or code fragment to be measured
      timer.end();
   }

   // After the measurements, the desired timing results can be calculated, as for instance the
   // average wall clock time
   double average = timer.average();
   \endcode
